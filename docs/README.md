A simple Add-On that allows for the XP Bar to be displayed at all times.

Setting saves Account-wide across all characters.

**PantherXP** references [Slightly Improved™ Experience Bar](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info73-SlightlyImprovedExperienceBar.html) by [L8Knight](https://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?action=getinfo&userid=1084).
